Friday the 13th (!!): Avoid superstitions and keep broken mirrors, black cats and ladders away from our code.

As this is day one, we want to use this day to become more familiar with the system and what we have to do. Find good resources online and different ticketing systems to give us a good idea of what we need to implement. We will share what we find in order to streamline our ideas and our thought process. Once we have a good grip of the system we want, we will talk about how to divide our tasks evenly to achieve the desired result.

  * what have I done since last scrum
                       - created an amazon account
                       - created an RDS instance
                       - linked up mysql and amazon web services

  * what do i need to do for next scrum
                     - trying to link java spring project to amazon RDS mysql database instance, so that our project can run online and not dependent on local database
                     - create account with heroku and test uploading the existing version of the project, and test out github hosting capabilities
                     - implement payment module
                     

  * are there any problems stopping me or need help with
                     - payment module seems to be a thorn in my side for now
                     - figuring out what changes need to be made to the project in application properties file so that our project runs online without local databases

Olivier:
There are a few things and tweaks to do on the project that I will be working on today. 
-Fix the rest response so that when the search function is activated, only the menu and not the whole page reloads (ajax)
-Create a dashboard for user and admin
-Receive a confirmation e-mail when the user books his ticket
-Make the website look nicer
-I'd like to add a functionality where you can search every dates and not just one date
-A payment processing system would be another good thing to have before friday

This should be enough for this morning


Scrum of wednesday 18-05-22

Olivier:
After yesterday's talk with the professor, I have tried to pivot away from the superficial functionalities mentioned above and tried to refocus on fixing the database. I'm trying to adapt the search functionalities to be able to search everything without having to choose a specific day and streamline the process. I also want to add an update function for the admin, since right now there is only an add and delete function.
Not much was done yesterday, I tried a lot of different approaches and nothing worked. Today's focus is on editing what we have.

Muhammad:

* what have I done since last scrum
                       - looked at approaches of how to start the system from scratch, since the professor has vehemently rejected the current database design

  * what do i need to do for next scrum
                      I'm trying to build a simplified system from scratch. Not technically scratch, I'm going to borrow elements from the main project, and if our main one is still going towards success, I can copy the modules of the new one and fine tune them for the new project. E.g. if the main project comes on the right path, I can copy my payment module, and fine tune it for the main one.
                      I didn't work on the payment module for now. But that is the task of today
                     

  * are there any problems stopping me or need help with
                     - far too many approaches are possible, and too many things can be added, but the focus should be on simplicity

Scrum of thurday 19-05-22

Olivier:
Its thursday so let's honor thor! *throws hammer at wall*
Yesterday I was re-did most of the file in order to adapt to the new circumstances and make it simpler and more streamlined. After a lot of work and bug-fixing I settled on a template that I'm very happy with. Today I will fix the last bugs and try to add some functionalities such as editing trips. Later I will merge my program with Muhammad's new functions and upload it to the cloud, and merge my program with Michael's frontend and this should give us our final version. Many bugs will be met along the way but this is why I brought along with my digital squasher.
