Friday the 13th (!!): Avoid superstitions and keep broken mirrors, black cats and ladders away from our code.

As this is day one, we want to use this day to become more familiar with the system and what we have to do. Find good resources online and different ticketing systems to give us a good idea of what we need to implement. We will share what we find in order to streamline our ideas and our thought process. Once we have a good grip of the system we want, we will talk about how to divide our tasks evenly to achieve the desired result.

  * what do i need to do for next scrum
                     - trying to link java spring project to amazon RDS mysql database instance, so that our project can run online and not dependent on local database
                     - create account with heroku and test uploading the existing version of the project, and test out github hosting capabilities
                     - implement payment module
                     

  * are there any problems stopping me or need help with
                     - payment module seems to be a thorn in my side for now

There are a few things and tweaks to do on the project that I will be working on today. 
-Fix the rest response so that when the search function is activated, only the menu and not the whole page reloads (ajax)
-Create a dashboard for user and admin
-Receive a confirmation e-mail when the user books his ticket
-Make the website look nicer
-I'd like to add a functionality where you can search every dates and not just one date
-A payment processing system would be another good thing to have before friday

This should be enough for this morning
